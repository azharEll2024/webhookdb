Please refer to your Service Agreement for details about what you can and cannot do
with this WebhookDB repository instance.

In general:

- Unless you have a source license, you should not be making changes to this code. When we update this code, your custom changes will likely be overwritten.
- Code here is not open source. We try to open source useful libraries we build, but what's here is not. If you want to use the application patterns here, we suggest checking out https://github.com/lithictech/suma, which is open source application we've built which uses similar patterns, and you can more liberally copy from that.

See `OPERATIONS.md` for details on operating WebhookDB in your environment.
