WebhookDB provides you with a URL you set up as a webhook target in 3rd party services.
We receive those webhooks and stash the data into a dedicated PostgreSQL database which you can query.

When you set up an integration, you also have the option to backfill historical resources.
This allows WebhookDB to be brought in at any stage during the development process.

WebhookDB is managed entirely through our lightweight, cross-platform, single-binary (and [open source!](https://github.com/lithictech/webhookdb-cli)) CLI that walks you through every step.

Check out our step-by-step [Quickstart Guide](/docs/cli) to get started.
