The premise of WebhookDB is simple: we provide you with a url to
send your webhooks to, then we intercept and archive those webhooks 
into a queryable SQL database for you. We'll also query the service 
API for a complete history of your application's data, and because this 
backfilling process is built into the functionality, WebhookDB can 
be brought in at any stage during the development process.

Our lightweight CLI makes the setup process easyâ€”check out our 
[CLI Quickstart Guide](/docs/cli) to get started.
